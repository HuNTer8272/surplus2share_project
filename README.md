# Surplus2Share 🍛

**Surplus2Share** is a web application built to reduce food waste by connecting food donors with NGOs who are in need. This platform allows users to post surplus food, and NGOs can request these donations for their causes. It helps ensure food reaches the needy instead of being wasted.

## 📌 Project Overview

Millions of people go hungry every day, while tons of edible food is wasted. Surplus2Share bridges this gap by creating a centralized platform where:

- **Donors** can post details of leftover/surplus food.
- **NGOs/Receivers** can request donations from listed posts.
- Once approved, the donation can be picked up or delivered.
- Users are notified about the status of their posts and requests.

This platform promotes responsible food sharing and supports NGO operations through digital coordination.
